# Godot Simple FPS Controller

Barebones FPS player controller for Godot. Stripped down and retooled from 0xspig's old school style character controller to be more contemporary styled and simple. Features include variable settings, coyote time, controller support with response curves, and multiplayer readiness. Made to be easily expanded upon and mostly commented.
